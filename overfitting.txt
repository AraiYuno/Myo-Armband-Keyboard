Question 3
a)
	Straight line:		Error = 0.47631744
	Parabola:		Error = 0.4351509
	Cubic: 			Error = 0.3917215
	4th order: 		Error = 0.425157
	5th order: 		Error = 0.19967277

b)
	The polynomial with degree 5 has the smallest error on the test set.

c)
	As the order of polynomial increases, the fitting line is passing thorough almose all the data and causing overfitting.
