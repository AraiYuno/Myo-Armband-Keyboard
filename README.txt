Instructions:
	1: Run assignment2/Linear Regression/linear_regression.py
	2: Run assignment2/Overfitting- Polynomial Regression/overfitting_polynomial.py
	
	3: Run assignment2/Myo Armband/Myo Keyboard/main.py


Myo Keyboard Program:
	The program can process y axis of accelerometer, y axis of gyrometer, all axes of accelerometer and all axes of gyrometer.
	Follow the instructions the program gives when main program is run.	

	The code is made to split the input data into 90 percent for training and 10 percent for testing. The prediction of input of testing data
	is done for 5 different key inputs and their accuracy is shown in the output.

	The output accuracy of 10 trial runs were taken for each of the 4 processing styles of data the program can perfom.The output is stored in
	'data_output-info.txt' for reference.
